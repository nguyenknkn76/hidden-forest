# Intro
Sus Pattern: every few months, a shiny new js framework emerges, promising  to solve all ur problems ~ Better performance, Cleaner syntax, More magic >< but constantly chasing the latest JS framework is often a huge waste of time
=> New frameworks: Innovation is still good but ask myself that: Am i building somthing meaningful, or just relearning how to build the same app in slightly different ways

# The Never Ending JS Hype Cycle
- The next big thing launches: New "Game changing" framework is released
- Everyone jumps on the hype train: Blog posts, Youtube tutorials is every where
- Reality sets in: Company needs apps that work reliably => careful to use it, step by step
- The hype fades: That framework grows up, become complexity and too hard to replace 
- Reapeat with a new name: Another framework appear and the cycle begins again

Example: Reactjs, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Qwik

# Rewriting Your App Again (and Again) Slows You Down
... Some strucgle here like:
- Each frameworks has its own syntax but they're all dongitn the exact same thing
=> All effort just end up building the same features that we already had
=> Spending more time to learning frameworks that building use features

# "The Best Framework" Doesn't Exist (Only Trade offs)
Tech discussions often devolve into debates about which framework reigns supreme. But here's the truth: there is no single "best" framework
Every framework has strength and weaknesses. So chaging framework is just " You're trading one set of problems for a diff set"
=> Stop searching for a mythical perfect framework and focused on what really matters - the fundamentals of building good software

# The Reality: Fundamentals Outlast Hype (and Pay the Bills)
Companies and serious projects prioritize stablility and maintainability over trendy tech. 
Some popular in job market like: Reactjs, Angular, etc. But how about the newer options? Something is cool this month, but it's risky and expensive to constantly chage tech stacks. Businesses need code that's proven to work and ez to maintain.
=> Mastering core skills and widely used tools will take you further

# Frameworks Won't Automatically Make You Better Dev
Being a great dev isn't about which framework u know - it's about understanding how to solve problems
- Breaking down complex features into simpler tasks
- Write clean code, good architecture
- Knowing how to debug issues, write tests, and handle edge cases
- Understading performance bottlenecks (why algorithm is slow)
- Being able to pick up any framework as needed b/c you understand the underlying concepts
+> core js skills, design patterns, browser web apis

# What I'm Donging Instead of Chasing Frameworks
- Double down on fundamentals
- Use frameworks as tools, not dogma
- Build real projects (even small ones)
- Keep eyes on trends, but bet on proven tech for serious work

# Final Thoughts
Frameworks will come and go. But the underlying principles of good dev remain constant: clean code, thoughtful architecture, problem-solving skillsand deep understading of tools
=> building smt that works and helps people
=.= keep codeing, keep growing and most importantly, enjoy the journey 
x.x p/s: awesome and useful posts with me in this time. It's Not only about frontend, js frameworks issues but also about dev, career or stuff like that. +1 respect
