# Pushed ts into every single project => it's sus. why
- the setup overhead isn't worth it: 
  - why am i spending 20 minutes wrestling wiht configs instead of actually writing code? 
  - ( for **a large-scale project**, this setup is pays off )
- ts slows down experimentation:
  - why am i writing extra code before i even know if this api is useful, inspite of the fact that it's safer
  - js's buggest strengths is its flexibility. but with ts, that agility disappears. =))
- ts's benefits aren't that useful in small projects 
  - ts helps prevent bugs. but in a small project, does it really matter
- the extra build step feels unnecessagry: this extra step can kills momentum (efforts or stuff like that)
- not every dependency plays nice with ts

# When i still use ts
- ts isn't bad but it sould be used for the right proejcts
  - large-scale apps 
  - projects with long-term maintenance in mind
  - codebases that rely heavily on strict contract between modules
- but for: 
  - side projects
  - quick scripts 
  - mvps and prototypes 
=> stick with js. it's faster, simpler, and more fun when you don't have fight the compiler

# TS is a tool, not a religion 
- someone treat ts like the only way to write js in 2025. but that's not true....
