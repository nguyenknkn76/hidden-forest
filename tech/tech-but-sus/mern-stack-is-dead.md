# Company using mern stack in production why
- bc vary stable nodejs, reacjs (dev in a long time) 
- company ez to hire dev 
- frontend, backend using js => no diff between frontend, backend dev => can hire fullstack dev => good for start up\
# smt idk
- Build basic project software => using mern stack 
- Search for reactjs, angularjs on linkedin (...) => compare between reactjs, angularjs (Reactjs = Angularjs)
- Nextjs,  nestjs is very new (it's not bad  but it's not very stable) 
  => Should learn should try nextjs, some new frameworks,... but not bet ur careerer on it
- MERN Stack is still ok (bc stablility, and good dev community)

- example: ruby on rail (don't see too much on career market but still be used by many companies)
