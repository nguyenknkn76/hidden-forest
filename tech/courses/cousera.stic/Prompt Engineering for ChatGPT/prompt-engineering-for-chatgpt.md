- Prompt engineering 
- The persona pettern (asked chatgpt to act as a pro)

### Large language models:

- predicts the next word based on the input prompt
- learn from data 
- prompt design and context: output base on input, and context (note: new info)
- randomnes in output


## Main Concepts

- What are prompt? 
  - user input → prompt trigger model → model return output
  - memory and information sharing: prompts retain context, new info from user → answer
- Prompt patterns?
  - strong pattern
  - specificity in prompt? generic prompts → generic response, detailed prompt → specific response
  - providing structure prompts → more desired output

- Program with prompts
